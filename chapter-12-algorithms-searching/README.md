We've talked about Recursion and Sorting, we have a few more to go. In this
section, we're going to talk about **Searching and Traversal**, including
**Breadth First Search** and **Depth First Search**.

Searching is something we do a lot on our computers. When we talked about
Sorting, some of you may have been like, "man, it doesn't really sound that
useful"; but Searching, we use that every day, don't we? We look for files in
our computer, we run command `f` and search for things, search for words and
documents, we search Google, we search Youtube, we search hashtag `#` on
Twitter and Instagram; Searching is a big part of our lives;

But, how are all these computers and programs able to search things so fast.
There's more and more data in this world, more and more Websites to search for.
How are we able to do these things so fast? How is google able to do these
things so fast?

Well, in this section we're going to build this foundation of how it all works.

We're going to be talking about a few types of Searching and Traversal, and
hopefully by the end of it all, you're going to understand how places like,
Facebook, Google, and Google Maps work when it comes to Searching at
**fundamental level**.

Let's get started.
