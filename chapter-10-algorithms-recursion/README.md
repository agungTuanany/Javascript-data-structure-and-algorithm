## Introduction to Algorithms

Welcome to the algorithm section; this us a word that immediately just sounds
nice right?  All the companies are using it these days to sound like they're
doing something really really important. Everybody has a secret algorithm, that
they use to make a machine learning models, analyze user data; make companies
lots of money.

But underneath the hood, algorithms are just functions that programmers write.
A two line functions technically an algorithm, a thousand line algorithm that
sort through images us also algorithm.

Algorithms is simply steps in a process that we take to perform a desired action
with computers. If we go to Wikipedia and search lists of algorithms, the list
is pretty endless, there are a lot of algorithms, it's impossible to know all
of them. You can create your own algorithms, you can use other algorithms that
are popular and well established.

Let's get back to our question of what are algorithms? If we combine our
knowledge of data structures, the ones that we worked on in the previous
section; algorithms allow us to use language built in data data structures like
arrays and objects, or primitive such as integers and boolean, and even custom
data types like we did when we use the class keyword to create Stacks, Queues,
Binary Search Trees. Algorithms allow us to use these data structures to perform
actions on that data.

Remember this right, **Data Structure and Algorithms create Programs**. In this
course we're going to talk about the most common interview algorithms, so that
long list on Wikipedia won't be as intimidating, because we're only going to
focus on the want that matter, especially for interviews; but also the ones that
matter most in you career; specifically we're going to go over these topics,
when it comes to algorithms.

Now, whey are these algorithms so common in interviews, and especially in big
companies; Well, you can get away with not knowing these topics for a long time
as a programmer, but as we have learned Big-O and scalability of code, is
important as companies get larger and larger. By learning these listed
algorithms we're able to do majority of the scaling, we need to improve our
programs. Remember our Big-O cheat-sheet, and how we haven't really talked about
`O(log N)`, and `O(N log N)`.

Certain algorithms allow us to simplify our Big-O complexity into smaller or
better time complexity. So, by using the right algorithms I could take a
function that has a Big-O `O(N^2)` down to something of `O(N log N)` or
something that has a linear time complexity to `O(log N)`; and these are used
everywhere in large companies, because large companies handle a lots of inputs,
lots of data; so, this topics is extremely important to them, and as your career
grows and grows, these topics will be more and more important to you.
