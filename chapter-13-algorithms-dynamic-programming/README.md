## Dynamic Programming Introduction

Welcome to our last section on algorithm's. The last missing piece and that is
"Dynamic Programming". Sounds very important doesn't it.

With these section we're going to go over the very last piece of our "mind map"
to complete our entire knowledge Graph.

It's last little piece of Dynamic Programming specifically **Memoization** that
we're going to be talking about. But what is it?

Dynamic Programming is just an "optimization technique". Here's a fun fact.
Dynamic Programming actually mean nothing. It's completely "garbage - Buzzword",
and I'm not kidding here. I'll link to a funny article on how the name came to
be, but Dynamic Programming at the end of the day is just an **optimization
techique** using something called **caching**.

If you have something that you can "cache". Well then, he can use Dynamic
Programming.

Now, we're going to get into details of what that means throughout the next
lesson, but at a higher - level programming is a way to solve problems by
breaking it down into a **collection of "sub - problems"**. Solving each of
those problems just once and storing their solutions in case next time the same
sub - problems occurs. But let's get into hat and understand what it means, how
we can implement it to become better interviewers, better engineers and better
programmers.

I'll see you in the next lecture.
