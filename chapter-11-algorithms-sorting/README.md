## Sorting Introduction

In the past when I learned about Sorting, it involved a lot of math, a lot of
different algorithms, and I just never really enjoyed it, because I didn't
understand why we need to know Sorting?, I mean, you just have a _sort function_
usually in programming language and that's it, right? I just never understood
the point of it, and you probably thinking the same thing.

Let me explain, in interview Sorting is _really important_. You hear question
lake take an array of numbers and _sort_ them; or the interviewer want you to
do something to some input, and they tell you that this input is Sorted, and
you're wandering why did they just tell us that? Why does it matter if it's
sorted or not?, and why do companies care so much about Sorting? If I can just
use the builtin _sort method_ in my own language.

Well, here's the thing, Sorting is not  a big deal when it comes to small input
data, you'd be right; you can do something like this,

```javascript
const letters = ["a", "d", "z", "e", "r", "b"];

letters.sort();

// Result
["a", "b", "d", "e", "r", "z"]
```


We've an array of `letters`, and this array simply has `["a", "d", "z", "e", "r",
"b" ]`; and if somebody asked to sort this, well we can just use something like
a _sort method_ that comes in most languages `letters.sort()`, If I run this
functions, I get back the sort letters; nice and easy, just sorted everything.

Why would companies ever ask such a simple question of us? You see the problem
is when inputs get larger and lager, kind of like when we talked about Big-O, we
don't care about small inputs; that's easy to do, especially with our modern
fast computers; it's starts costing companies a lot of money when we have to
perform operations on larger and larger _data sets_; that's when things becomes
a little bit crazy and expensive.

For example, Google has a ton of Websites that are indexed. What if they need to
sort those Websites? In a way, perhaps _sorting a news article_ based on the time
that it was released?; and because we are talking about Google here, we're not
talking about ten articles, we're talking about thousand, million more articles
sorted based on _date_.

What about Amazon? Amazon is all about Sorting, they sort their product based
on _category_, based on _price_, based on _rating_, and they have millions of
products.

What about Apple? Well, Apple has the Apple-Store, and they list all their
_apps_ in some of a sorted order, _podcasts_ in sorted order.

What about Microsoft? Well Microsoft, they need to sort of all their logs, or
let's say their data center around the world. So that if an incident happens,
they know where it's coming from.

What about Netflix? Well Netflix, they need to sorted their _shows_, their
_movies_, their _TV shows_, somehow, right?.

They can't usually just use a builtin _sort method_ that comes with the
language, and they usually need custom sorted method based on the data; so that,
they can lower their cost, and lower the operations that their computers need to
do.

Most places sort their data or pre-process it and these companies including
small one usually sort data to make sure that it's _meaningful_; if it's random
data that is not sorted, it's really really hard to access. So, most of the time
we sort data or pre-process it.

Now, the examples that I just talked about, they are a little bit silly, but it
does prove my point. For these companies if they do something wrong, or they do
it in an inefficient way, it means losing a lot of money. That's why they ask
these questions in an interview. They want to make sure you understand how
important the topic is, and then you can make right decision as you employee;
what sorting algorithms should be used based on the problems.

So, that's the goal of this section. I'm going to show you how to implement
Sorting on your own, if you want; but most importantly we're going to talk about
the **_different sorting algorithms_** available to you; and how we can make the
right decisions for your company, and obviously to a start coding interview.

Now, the reason that most Sorting Algorithm lessons get really boring, is that
there's so many Sorting algorithms. If we search sorting algorithms on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm), you get a pretty
large list, and implementing these Sorts one by one yourself, takes a lot of
time, but most likely you will never implement your own Sorting algorithm in
your life, except for maybe a simple one in an interview, because mos of these,
especially the advanced ones that are really fast, are done by academics that
spend years figuring out what the best most optimal way of Sorting is; and
interviewers don't expect to be able to implement every single Sorting
algorithm.

My goal in this section is, to teach the hight level; why you need to know to
become a better engineer; and also the coding interviews, I'll show you how to
implement some of the poor Sorting algorithms; but more importantly, we're going
to talk about the trade-offs between them so that you're able to talk about them
intelligently during an interview.

For the next few lecture, we are going to talk about these Sorting algorithms,
an also a couple of bonus ones towards the end; but the key thing to remember
is, that as more and more data is handled by our computers, which is a big
trending computing Sorting and Searching are two of the biggest Computer Science
problems in the software world.

 Searching, we're going to get into in the next section. But Sorting is
something we'll we have for the master at the end of this lectures. So, let's go
learn how to make a good decision when ti comes to Sorting.
