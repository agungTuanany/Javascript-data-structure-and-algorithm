## Module Introduction

What is a data structure? Is a collection of values. What is
algorithms? Is the steps or process we put into place to manipulate these
collection of values, it's what allows us to write programs.

A person who knows how data structures and algorithms work, and how to use them,
can write great programs. The beauty is that these are _timeless_, no matter
what programming language you use, whether you prefer one library over the
other, whether you write code in Angular or React or Svelte or Vue in the
frontend development world, or you are game developer. Underneath it all, it's
all data structures and algorithms. If you understand these, then you can really
easily adapt and tackle all sorts of technical problems. It's why companies like
FAANG as questions specific to data structures and algorithms, because although
it may be important to know the latest and greatest JavaScript syntax or maybe
the latest and greatest library, _those things change_, if you know the
fundamentals though, then they can throw you any problem, any situation, and you
are able to make the right decision. This knowledge is extremely valuable.

The longer you are on the field, the more and more you realize that you need
these fundamental principle of data structures and algorithms in order to be
a great developer or engineers.


Over the next few sections, we have a long way to go to get familiar with data
structures and algorithms, so can write a good programs. Let's get started.

## What is a Data Structure

Data structure is a collection of values, the values can have relationship among
them, and they can have functions applied to them. Each one is different in what
it can do, and what it is best used for. Most important thing to take away is
that each data structure is good and is Specialized for its own thing.

You can think of data structures as any sort of compartment or container, a data
structure is simply a file cabinet of different types. You have  a _backpack_
a place where you put maybe your school books, you have _drawer_ where you pull
clothes, you have a _fridge_ where you put your food, a _folder_ for your files,
and a _packing box_ maybe for your toys.

Each one of these container are useful for it's own thing, for example I'm not
going to put my food in a _drawer_ because that _yogurt_ is going to go bad in
_drawer_, likewise I'm not going to put all my _papers_ and _files_ in my
_backpack_ or perhaps a _packing toy box_ because it's just going to get crumple
up.

Each one of these containers are specific for it's own thing, and that's what
data structure really is. It's a way for us to organize data, so that we can go
into the _backpack_ and retrieve that data really easily. We can go into the
_fridge_ and grab that _popsicle_ or _ice cream_ really fast.  We can put things
in data structures and we can take things from data structures, and that's all
it really is.


There are a ton of data structures, just like in our real life, how we have all
these containers hold these places to put things in. In programming we have
a ton of them. If we go to
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures) for example,
while if we scroll through here see see a ton of data structures. This is going
look overwhelming, but don't worry most of these while I've never encountered
myself, and they're very-very specific. You probably only have about _five_ or
_six_ data structures that are really-really important that we're going to go
over.

You may even heard about _Bitcoin_ and how to use _Block chain_ technology, this
magical word, well _Block chain_ at the end of the day is simply a data
structure, a way to hold information.

So in our programming world, data structures, we can store things like
_numbers_, _string_, _boolean types_ just like we saw when we coded in
JavaScript with arrays and objects. **_Arrays and objects in JavaScript_** are
each a **_form of data structure_** that allows us to store information.

As human, this what we do on Earth, we take the chaos and the disorder, and make
order out of it, at least we try to, we organize our farms to produce food. We
package the food and we deliver them to the grocery stores and organize them in
the grocery store, so that human can grab those, and can then purchase these
groceries and give money to put in a compartment (space) and a bank. That's all
programs are, we're modeling  real life scenarios.

The more advanced a developer you become, the more time you will start thinking
and spending time talking about data structures. This is why interviewers love
to talk about data structures.

As I always like to mention, there are always tradeoffs. Every programming
question has a tradeoff. Remember are the are three pillars of _Readability_,
_Memory_ and _Speed_ when we talked about what code is best, well we have the
same thing with data structures. One is better than the other in some aspects,
and the other better than the other, that's why they exist, each one for its own
specific case, and there are two parts to understanding data structures.

<br />

`[1]` _How to actually Build One_, how can we build with code some of these data
structures?; `[2]` _How to Use it_. We're going to do both of these in this
course, but the _second point_ is the most important. Because data structures
are usually just tools and most of the time they're already pre-built for us.
The most important part is, how to use them? When to use one over the other? And
we kind of saw a little bit of that in the previous section, when we talked
about how to solve problems, where we used an _object_ versus an _array_ to make
our code more efficient.

The goal in this course is to understand data structures, so that you can pick
the right data structure for your problems. Based on different scenarios, data
needs to be stored in a specific format. We have a handful of data structures
that cover our need to store data in different formats.

Let's get a little bit deeper into this topic.
