## Module Introduction

What is a data structure? Is a collection of values. What is
algorithms? Is the steps or process we put into place to manipulate these
collection of values, it's what allows us to write programs.

A person who knows how data structures and algorithms work, and how to use them,
can write great programs. The beauty is that these are _timeless_, no matter
what programming language you use, whether you prefer one library over the
other, whether you write code in Angular or React or Svelte or Vue in the
frontend development world, or you are game developer. Underneath it all, it's
all data structures and algorithms. If you understand these, then you can really
easily adapt and tackle all sorts of technical problems. It's why companies like
FAANG as questions specific to data structures and algorithms, because although
it may be important to know the latest and greatest JavaScript syntax or maybe
the latest and greatest library, _those things change_, if you know the
fundamentals though, then they can throw you any problem, any situation, and you
are able to make the right decision. This knowledge is extremely valuable.

The longer you are on the field, the more and more you realize that you need
these fundamental principle of data structures and algorithms in order to be
a great developer or engineers.


Over the next few sections, we have a long way to go to get familiar with data
structures and algorithms, so can write a good programs. Let's get started.
