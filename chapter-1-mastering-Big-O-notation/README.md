## Module Introduction

The Big-O is a concept will be around for very long time, and something will
make you to be a better developer. Big companies all know Big-O, this which is
why you won't get by any of their interviews without encountering this topic.

Any coder can solve given enough time can solve a problem. What matters is
though how well the problem is solved; And this is where Big-O can help us. It
can tell us how well a problem is solved. We're gonna find out what that means
in this Module.

We going talk about Big-O, what it is? How we define it? And then we're going to
use Big-O and it's different notation to distinguish bad code from good code,
good code from great code. We are going to be comfortable with this topic, that
we are going to not to be surprised when this comes up in our interviews. But
we're also going to build this big foundation that is important to be a great
developer.

The reason this topic is at the beginning of this course is that you will see
the Big-O notation came up again and again as we go into topics such as _data
structures_ and _algorithms_.

## What is Good Code

There are two main things we talk about when we say this is good code. What
would you tell somebody if you're asking them to write good code?.

<br />

Code can be described in tow points, `[1]`**Readability**, is your code just
generally clean? Can others can understand your code?. `[2]`**Scalable Code**.
Big-O notation is what allows us to measure this idea of scalable; code that can
scale. Something that we're going to get into and you're going to become more
familiar with as we go through this section.

We also going to talk about readable code throughout this entire course, but
touch upon it a little bit more in the next section. For now, because this is
the Big-O section, we're focusing on this idea of scalable code. What does this
really mean thug?

Well I want you to imagine we have a task where we want to bake a cake. We have
a recipe, and this recipe we're going to use in our kitchen to bake a cake; And
there's a good way of baking a cake and a bad way. We give the instruction that
is their recipe, and hopefully this recipe and instruction work well with our
kitchen so that w can bake a cake quickly, and become a good cake.

Well computers are machines; And this machines need to works in order to produce
something for us; And the computers work in the same way. We have these
instructions that we give it through code, and these these instructions that we
give to our machine (computers) give these instructions that provide for us some
sort of an output, for example to turn on the light. We give the computer
instruction to say, hey turn ion the light in our room. A coder is someone that
gives these instructions just like there are many ways to take a cake into
a kitchen or just like there are many ways to bake a cake in the kitchen with
many recipes, ingredients and instructions, there are many ways to solve
a problem through code. They're efficient and inefficient ways to give
instructions.

We have an example of instruction that we're giving our computer called
[findNemo](./findNemo.js). We call this the runtime. How long does it takes to
run a certain problem through a function or a task? How can we measure the Big-0
with this findNemo function? Or the efficiency of this function?.

We're going to try and measure the performance of findNemo function and see what
happens when the arrays gets larger. We're going to tie things together as to
what scaleable means, and how Big-O allows us to measure the scalability.
