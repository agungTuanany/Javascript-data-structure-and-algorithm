## Module Introduction

The Big-O is a concept will be around for very long time, and something will
make you to be a better developer. Big companies all know Big-O, this which is
why you won't get by any of their interviews without encountering this topic.

Any coder can solve given enough time can solve a problem. What matters is
though how well the problem is solved; And this is where Big-O can help us. It
can tell us how well a problem is solved. We're gonna find out what that means
in this Module.

We going talk about Big-O, what it is? How we define it? And then we're going to
use Big-) and it's different notation to distinguish bad code from good code,
good code from great code. We are going to be comfortable with this topic, that
we are going to not to be surprised when this comes up in our interviews. But
we're also going to build this big foundation that is important to be a great
developer.

The reason this topic is at the beginning of this course is that you will see
the Big-O notation came up again and again as we go into topics such as _data
structures_ and _algorithms_.
